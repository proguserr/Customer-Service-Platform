How I Built This Fullstack AI Chatbot (React + FastAPI + Redis + GPT)

This project is a complete AI chatbot application I built to explore full-stack development with real-time capabilities. It combines a React frontend with a FastAPI backend, Redis for state management, and Huggingface’s GPT-J for language responses.

Why I Built It?

I wanted to learn how modern chat applications work end-to-end, including how to:
	•	Design a scalable architecture
	•	Integrate a generative AI model
	•	Handle real-time bi-directional messaging with WebSockets
	•	Persist chat history using Redis
	•	Build a clean UI using React



Tech Stack I Used
	•	Frontend: React 18 for the chat UI
	•	Backend: FastAPI with WebSocket support
	•	AI Model: GPT-J-6B via Huggingface Inference API
	•	Database: Redis JSON and Redis Streams
	•	Architecture: WebSocket-based real-time chat system



How It Works
	1.	Frontend (React)
	•	I built a simple chat interface using React.
	•	It communicates with the backend using WebSockets to support real-time chat.
	2.	Backend (FastAPI)
	•	FastAPI handles WebSocket connections and routes messages between the frontend and the AI model.
	•	It also interfaces with Redis to store and retrieve chat history.
	3.	Redis
	•	I used Redis JSON to store user prompts and responses.
	•	Redis Streams helped manage real-time message queues between the chatbot and the inference API.
	4.	GPT-J via Huggingface API
	•	I chose GPT-J-6B because it’s free and powerful enough for many tasks.
	•	Huggingface’s API made it easy to integrate without hosting the model myself.

The app consists of:
	•	A React client that sends and receives messages via WebSockets.
	•	A FastAPI server that connects with Redis and forwards prompts to GPT-J.
	•	A Redis backend that stores conversations and supports message streams.
	•	An AI model API (GPT-J) for generating natural language replies.



 What I Learned
	•	How to set up real-time WebSocket communication using FastAPI
	•	Using Redis Streams and Redis JSON for managing live chat data
	•	Connecting React apps with WebSockets
	•	Deploying a lightweight full-stack AI app using open-source tools
